# Notes

## Questions I'd like to be able to answer

### What happens when we are two(or more) developers on the same thing?

- Pre-integration test
- Always fix the master if the master is broken
- Can the CI system ( another Actor ) notify the developer
- What if we have unittests ( Perhaps writing tested code takes double the amount of time?)

### How much time do we spend in an _unreleasable_ state ( ie. with bugs)

- Can we say that value is diminished by some percentage of bugs
- How about different degrees of bugs ( Cosmetic -> Total Outage )
## Random Notes

- Should we add a _customer_ or _user_ `Actor`
### No commits made

## The story of the application that we are trying to simulate?

If it is a webapplication we can easily _model_ different environments and so on.


A silly point is possibly that if you never commit to master, then you never deliver value.
It might be a fun joke.

Same point can probably be made about never pushing/integrating as well.

### Drakes law

Can some analogy be said about a bad simulation or something can still give great
talking points, or actual ideas.
