# Life of Dev

For simulating development workflows to see the impact of strategy decisions.

## Usage

`java -jar  lifeofdev.jar`

## Building

It is possible to build a self contained jar using the command `./gradlew uberjar`.

This software requires that you have [Groovy](https://groovy-lang.org) installed
and configured.

## Further work:

### Use JGit for scm backend
Make it work with actual repository, this might make it easier to work with remotes
or could make cool integrations/comparisons of CI engines.
